# Vocab-YOU

I feel this project is a good indication of skills learned as of week 10 at Nashville Software School's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp we were tasked with creating an application that allows users to CRUD vocabulary cards, authenticate with Google, and filter.

## About Vocab-You

This application main purpose is to store note cards centered around Tech-Vocabulary with the ability to see, share, and gather information from mutual users of the program.

## Using Vocab-You

After authentication, users can begin by adding a category they would like to store information about.
