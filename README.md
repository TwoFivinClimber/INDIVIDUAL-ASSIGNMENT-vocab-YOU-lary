# Vocab-YOU

I feel this project is a good indication of skills learned as of week 10 at Nashville Software School's Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. We were tasked with creating an application that allows users to CRUD vocabulary cards, authenticate with Google, and filter.

## About Vocab-You

This application main purpose is to store note cards centered around Tech-Vocabulary with the ability to see, share, and gather information from mutual users of the program.

## Using Vocab-You
### Visit the site at : https://voacb-you.netlify.app

#### After authentication, users can begin by adding a category they would like to store information about.

#### Users can then create their first card that is added to their "My Cards" section on the Nav Bar.

#### The "My Cards" tab brings the user to the landing page for the site.
Users can update, delete, sort, and make their cards public or private using the icons on each card.

#### Selecting a Category in the "My Categories" tab located on the Nav Bar will show all cards that have been created with that category.

#### Selecting "Community Cards" from the Nav Bar displays the card that have been created by other users of the site.
Users cannot CRUD on these cards but are welcome to copy them to their own collection by selecting add to collection.  The user who created the card is shown on the origional card as well.  When a user copies a card, the note on the copied card references the user the card was copied from.
